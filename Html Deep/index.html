                This paragraph is just proof that I know how to create paragraphs for websites. 
            <br>
                If fact not only can I create paragraphs in html, but I can break sentences into different lines as well.
            <br>
                <b>see</b> I did it again. not only did I break the line, but I made the World see thick. How? 
                <br>
                cause i'm that guy. It's <i>Funny</i> to think that developers only had html to build with back in the day.

                <p>Most people look over HTML and dive deep into their programming language, but I believe that there is something to be found in html</p>
